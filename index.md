**Motivation and Scope (Call for Papers):**

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) has become a potent tool in the domains on next-generation computing and networked systems, and sustainable and innovative energy systems, addressing complex tasks across edge computing, data centers, wireless networks, cyber-physical systems, quantum computing and communication, just to name a few. Enhancing the performance of AI/ML based technology development in these domains and facilitating AI/ML on top of a wide spectrum of systems, energy and emerging applications have become increasingly paramount. Recent research has highlighted the effectiveness of AI/ML techniques, including but not limited to reinforcement and online learning, federated and distributed learning, deep learning, generative AI, Large language models (LLMs), trustworthy and privacy-preserving AI/ML, in compromising such systems. Therefore, developing efficient, reliable and robust AI/ML algorithms for future systems, energy and emerging applications is crucial, especially ones that can operate effectively with limited energy, communication and computation resources. In response to these challenges, this workshop aims to bring together researchers from the AI/ML, networking, systems and energy fields globally to address open issues in this interdisciplinary research area. This workshop is intended to provide a focus on AI/ML technologies at SIGMETRICS conferences for talks on early research on the subject.

The workshop topics include but not limited to:

* AI/ML modeling, methods and evaluations for next-generation networked systems
* AI/ML methods for job scheduling in computing systems
* Explainable AI/ML solutions for networked systems
* AI/ML augmented network management
* Distributed/federated training, learning and inference over networked and energy
systems
* Trustworthy and privacy-preserving AI/ML for networked and energy systems
* Decarbonization of AI/ML methods for networked and energy systems
* AI/ML assisted design and operation of sustainable energy systems
* LLMs pre-training, fine-tuning and inference over networked and energy systems
* LLMs based hardware design or system optimization techniques
* System and infrastructure for AI/ML with foundation models

**Workshop Length:** One full day

**Submission Guidelines:** Workshop submissions must be in English and formatted according to the standard ACM Performance Evaluation Review ([PER](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/0swxwn7nqsonlsr1lka27/sig-alternate-per-modified.cls?rlkey=xsyp6b5u0qri6ysbm7fkiba5x&dl=0)) style. We accept both abstracts and short papers. Abstracts could be work at an early stage, opinion pieces, or research proposals, with 2-3 pages (a maximum limit of 3 pages). Short papers could be ongoing work, work in preparation, or research work under submission, or published works, with 4-6 pages (a maximum limit of 6 pages). Submissions do not have to reach the maximum page limit. Submissions that do not adhere to these formatting guidelines will be automatically rejected without review. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process.

All submissions will undergo review by the program committee, and a selection of papers will be chosen for inclusion in the workshop program. Accepted papers will be published in a special issue of PER, with a submission deadline set after the workshop. Optionally, the final version of the accepted papers and abstracts can be revised to up to 6 pages. This allows authors to incorporate insights from workshop discussions into their final versions. AI Crossroads is a single-blind workshop. Therefore, authors MUST include their names and affiliations on the manuscript.

Authors of accepted papers grant ACM permission to publish them in both print and digital formats. However, there are no copyright restrictions with PERâ€”authors retain full copyright of their work and have complete freedom to submit it elsewhere, as explicitly stated in the standard PER format.
